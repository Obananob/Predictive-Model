## The Task
The Excellent Store Challenge

Impact Stores, popularly known as “The Excellent Store”, is a leading indigenous chain of stores with headquarters in Gbagi, Oyo, Nigeria. At the core of their business is a strong sense of excellence and entrepreneurial value. And this is evident in all their 1,500 products, available to all segments of the population at customer-friendly prices, across 10 stores in different cities of Nigeria.

The CEO of the company, Chief A. A. Babatunji, plans to expand the chain of stores to more Nigerian cities in 2025. However, as the COVID19 restrictions have affected the retail business, he sees the need to better understand which products return higher profits at specific stores so as to inform the expansion plan.

You have been engaged as the new Retail Data Analyst to build a predictive model and find out the profit returns on each product at a particular store. The scenario he sees is where a brand of juice sold for N250 in one of his store branches may also be sold at N230 at another store within Chief Babatunji's chain of stores. He needs to therefore understand what type of product, market clusters and store type (location, age, size) will give more profit returns as he plans to expand to more cities in the country.

From your predictions, Chief Babatunji will understand the key characteristics of items and stores, which drive returns and have better insight on how to proceed with the plan of expansion.

## The Solution
 I built a predictive model to analyze which stores and products are the most profitable. The findings show that Supermarket Type1 stores perform best, making them ideal for expansion. Store location matters, with Cluster 3 and Cluster 2 yielding higher returns. Store age also influences profitability, as older stores show stable financial growth. Pricing strategies must be optimized, as the same item may have different profit margins across stores. Some stores, like BABATUNJI027 and BABATUNJI019, stand out as top performers and should be studied. To expand successfully, Chief Babatunji should prioritize high-performing store types and profitable locations. Optimizing pricing strategies and learning from successful stores will further improve profit returns. These insights will help him make informed decisions for the company’s future growth.
